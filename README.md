# Felix's Rats!
A Minecraft mod that adds some cute little monsters :)

Rats can be [tamed](https://github.com/ItsFelix5/Felixs-Rats/blob/master/src/main/resources/data/rats/tags/item/rat_eatable.json) and will spawn in any structure.

These critters will fight for you, heal if they have food, fetch [valuables](https://github.com/ItsFelix5/Felixs-Rats/blob/master/src/main/resources/data/rats/tags/item/valuable.json), mine ores and wood, farm, breed, blow everything up, just anything you would want from a rat!
